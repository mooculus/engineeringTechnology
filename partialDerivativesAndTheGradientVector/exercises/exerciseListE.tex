\part{Partial derivatives and the gradient vector}

%The files with sage will not compile on my computer; I will look into downloading this at some point, but I'll add the exercises that I know my students will need for this semester.  I'll add to the main list as well, but it's likely many will be repetitive.

%Need to add some "applications" like on the worksheet (eg harmonic functions, analytic functions, solutions to PDE, etc) I'll do this when I have more time.

%Will add an exercise or appendix about constructing the classical example of a function for which f_{xy}(a,b) \neq f_{yx}(a,b)
