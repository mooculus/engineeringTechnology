\practice{arclengthFromGraph2}%new - Bart, I am too busy to alter this from your sample exam( where it is under the name polygonalCurve) other than adding one other part.  In the future, I will return and write a related exercise, but I want my students to see this.  If you want this only to appear on your sample exam, please comment it out of the exercise list.
