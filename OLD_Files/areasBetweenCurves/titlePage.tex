\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Apply the procedure of ``Slice, Approximate, Integrate'' to derive a formula for the area bounded by given curves.
\item Understand the difference between net and total area.
\item Find the area bounded by several curves.
\item Set up an integral or sum of integrals with respect to $x$ that gives the area bounded by several curves.
\item Set up an integral or sum of integrals with respect to $y$ that gives the area bounded by several curves.
\item Decide whether to integrate with respect to $x$ or $y$.
\end{itemize}
