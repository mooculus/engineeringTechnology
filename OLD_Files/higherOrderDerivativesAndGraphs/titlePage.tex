After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.


\begin{itemize}
\item Use the first derivative to determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing.
\item Define higher order derivatives.
\item Compare differing notations for higher order derivatives.
\item Identify the relationships between the function and its first and second derivatives.
\item Sketch a graph of the second derivative, given the original function.
\item Sketch a graph of the original function, given the graph of its first or second derivative.
\item Sketch a graph of a function satisfying certain constraints on its higher-order derivatives.
\item State the relationship between concavity and the second derivative.
\item Interpret the second derivative of a position function as acceleration.
\item Calculate higher order derivatives.
\item Given the graph of a position function, find time intervals where the velocity is positive/negative
\item Given the graph of a position function, find time intervals where the velocity is increasing/decreasing
