\begin{exercise}
Consider the ideal gas law, given by $PV=nRT$, relating pressure, $P$, volume, $V$, and the temperature $T$ of $n$ moles of gas, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. We can view $P$, $V$ and $T$ each as functions of the other two variables. 

If the volume of a gas is decreasing at a rate of $0.3\unit{L/min}$ and temperature is increasing at a rate of $0.5\unit{K/min}$, how fast is the pressure changing? Express your answer in terms of $P$, $V$, $n$ and $R$ alone.
\begin{hint}
  Make sure your answer only contains the variables $P$, $V$, $n$, and $R$.
\end{hint}

\[
\dd[P]{t}=\answer{\frac{n R+0.6 P}{2V}}
