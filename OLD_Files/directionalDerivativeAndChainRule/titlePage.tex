\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute directional derivatives.
\item Use the directional derivative to show that the gradient vector points in the initial direction of greatest increase for the function. 
\item View the chain rule in terms of the gradient.
\item Compute the derivative of the composition of a function of
  several variables with a vector-valued function.
\item Use the chain rule of several variables to implicitly
  differentiate a curve.
\end{itemize}
