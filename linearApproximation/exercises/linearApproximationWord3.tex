The kinetic energy of a moving object is $E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$.  A $61 \text{ kg}$ runner is moving at $10 \frac{\textrm{km}}{\textrm{h}}$.  However, her speedometer is only accurate to within $0.1 \frac{\textrm{km}}{\textrm{h}}$.  What is the potential error in her calculated kinetic energy, as a result of the imprecision in the measurement of her velocity?

\begin{prompt}
	The potential error is $\pm \answer{61} \frac{\textrm{kg} \cdot \textrm{km}^2}{\textrm{h}^2}$ 
\end{prompt}
