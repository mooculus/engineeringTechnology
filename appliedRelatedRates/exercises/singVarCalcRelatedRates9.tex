\begin{exercise}


A balloon is at a height of 50 meters, and is rising at the constant rate
of 5 m/sec.  A bicyclist passes beneath it, traveling in a
straight line at the constant speed of 10 m/sec.  How fast is the distance
between the bicyclist and the balloon increasing 2 seconds later?
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \answer{\frac{5\sqrt{10}}{2}}\,\text{m/s}
  \]
