\begin{exercise}




        	Two row boats start at the same location, and start traveling apart along straight lines which meet at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$.

        	Boat $A$ is traveling at a rate of $5$ miles per hour directly east, and boat $B$ is traveling at a rate of $10$ miles per hour going both north and east.

	How fast is the distance between the rowboats increasing $3$ hours into the journey? 

\begin{prompt}
	The rowboats are diverging from each other at a rate of $\frac{225}{\sqrt{675}}$ miles each hour.
\end{prompt}
