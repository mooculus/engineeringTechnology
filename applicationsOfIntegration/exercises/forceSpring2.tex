Hooke's Law states that the force required to displace a spring $x$ meters from equilibrium is given by $F(x) = kx$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.  If $60 J$ of work is required to stretch a spring $3 m$ from its equilibrium position, find the amount of force required to stretch the spring $2 m$ from its equilibrium position.

The force required is $\answer{\frac{240}{9}} N$.

\begin{hint}
Note that the work, not the force, is given!  Find the work in terms of $k$ first.  The integral is:

\[
W = \int_{\answer{0}}^{\answer{3}} \answer{ k x } \d x
\]

\begin{question}
Using $W=60$ and evaluating the integral gives:

\[
60 = \answer{\frac{9}{2}} k
\]
\end{question}

\end{hint}
