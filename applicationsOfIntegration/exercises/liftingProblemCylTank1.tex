\begin{exercise}

A cylindrical tank has base diameter $4\unit{m}$ and height
$10\unit{m}$. Suppose the tank is filled with water ($\rho=1000
\unit{kg}/\unit{m}^3$). Set up an integral that gives the work
required to pump the water out of the tank then evaluate it.  Use
$g=9.8 \unit{m}/\unit{s}^2$.

\begin{image}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	
	\fill [blue,opacity=0.5] (0,0) ellipse (0.4 and 0.1);
	\fill [blue,opacity=0.5] (-0.4,0) -- (-0.4,-1) arc (180:360:0.4 and 0.1) -- (0.4,0) arc (0:180:0.4 and 0.1);
	
	\draw (0,0) ellipse (0.4 and 0.1);
	\draw (-0.4,0) -- (-0.4,-1);
	\draw (-0.4,-1) arc (180:360:0.4 and 0.1);
	\draw [dashed,opacity=0.75] (-0.4,-1) arc (180:360:0.4 and -0.1);
	\draw (0.4,-1) -- (0.4,0);  
	
	\draw[decoration={brace,raise=.1cm},decorate,thin] (-0.4,-1) -- (-0.4,0);
	\node[anchor=east] at (-0.5,-0.5) {\tiny $10$m};
	
	\draw[decoration={brace,raise=.1cm},decorate,thin] (0.4,-1.1) -- (-0.4,-1.1);
	\node[anchor=north] at (0,-1.2) {\tiny $4$m};

\[
W= \int_{y=\answer{0}}^{y=\answer{10}} \answer{39200\pi (10-y)}\d y = \answer[tolerance=10]{1960000\pi} \unit{J}
\]
\begin{hint}
Set the height $y=0$ at the base of the tank.  We want to use the
formula:

\[ 
W = \int_{y=0}^{y=b} \rho g A(y) d(y) \d y
\]

Since $b$ is the height to which the tank is filled, $b=\answer{10}$.

Since $h$ is the height to which the water must be moved,
$h=\answer{10}$.

You want to move a slice at height $y$ to a height of $10$. Letting
$d(y)$ represent the distance that a slice at height $y$ travels to
get to a height of $10$, we set $d(y) = \answer{10-y}$.

The cross-sectional area of this tank is:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{is constant.}
\choice{varies depending on the height $y$ of the slice}.
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{question}
Noting that the \emph{diameter} of the tank is given, the cross-sectional area is $A(y) = 4 \pi$.
\end{question}
