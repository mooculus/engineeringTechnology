A modified Hooke's Law states that the force required to displace a spring $x$ meters from equilibrium is given by $F(x) = kx^2$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.  

Let $W_1$ denote the work required to stretch the spring $2 m$ from its equilibrium position and $W_2$ denote the work required to stretch the spring $4 m$ from its equilibrium position.  Then which of the following describes the relationship between $W_1$ and $W_2$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$W_2=W_1$}
\choice{$W_2 = 2 W_1$}
\choice{$W_2 = 4 W_1$}
\choice[correct]{None of these} 
\end{multipleChoice}

In fact, $W_2 = \answer{8} W_1$.
