Hooke's Law states that the force required to displace a spring $x$ meters from equilibrium is given by $F(x) = kx$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.  If $40 N$ is required to stretch a spring $4 m$ from its equilibrium position, find the amount of work required to stretch the spring this distance.

The work done is $\answer{80} J$.

\begin{hint}
First, by using Hooke's law, we find that $k = \answer{10} N/m$.  Now find the work required.
