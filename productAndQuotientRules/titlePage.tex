\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify products of functions.
	\item Use the product rule to calculate derivatives.
	\item Identify quotients of functions.
	\item Use the quotient rule to calculate derivatives.
	\item Combine derivative rules to take derivatives of more complicated functions.
        \item Explain the signs of the terms in the numerator of the quotient rule.
       % \item Multiply tangent lines to justify the product rule.
	\item Use the product and quotient rule to calculate derivatives from a table of values.
\end{itemize}
