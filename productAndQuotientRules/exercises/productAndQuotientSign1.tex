\begin{exercise}

Let $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$

If you know that $A(2) > 0$, $A'(2) > 0$, $B(2) > 0$, and $B'(2) < 0$, what can you say about the sign of $P'(2)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$P'(2)>0$}
\choice{$P'(2)<0$}
\choice{$P'(2) = 0$}
\choice[correct]{We cannot determine the sign of $P'(2)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

Try to make sense of this by thinking about small increases/decreases in the quantities $A$ and $B$, in addition to symbolic calculation.
