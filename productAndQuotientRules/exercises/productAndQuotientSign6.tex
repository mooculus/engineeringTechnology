Let $Q(x) = \frac{A(x)}{B(x)}$

If you know that $A(-4) > 0$, $A'(-4) > 0$, $B(-4) > 0$, and $B'(-4) > 0$, what can you say about the sign of $Q'(-4)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$Q'(-4)>0$}
\choice{$Q'(-4)<0$}
\choice{$Q'(-4) = 0$}
\choice[correct]{We cannot determine the sign of $Q'(-4)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

Try to make sense of this by thinking about small increases/decreases in the quantities $A$ and $B$, in addition to symbolic calculation.
