\outcome{Understand the relationship between a Taylor Polynomials and the function it represents}


\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}
Suppose that $f(x)$ is an infinitely differentiable function at $x=17$ and that the \emph{fourth} degree Taylor polynomial of $f(x)$ centered at $x=17$ is:

\[
p_3(x) = 2-3(x-17)+4(x-17)^2+7(x-17)^3+2(x-17)^4
\]

\begin{exercise}
Is there enough information to determine $f'''(17)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes}
\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
In fact, $f'''(17) = \answer{42}$.

\begin{hint}
Since the coefficients of the Taylor Polynomial and the values of the derivatives of the function are related via the formula:

\[
a_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}
\]
We have that $c=\answer{17}$, $a_3 = \answer{7}$ and that $f'''(0)$ can be found using this formula with $k=
\answer{3}$.   
\end{hint}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Is there enough information to determine $f^{(5)}(17)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}


\begin{hint}
Since the coefficients of the Taylor Polynomial and the values of the derivatives of the function are related via the formula:

\[
a_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}
\]
We have that $c=\answer{17}$ and would need information about $a_5$, which would be the coefficient of $(x-17)^5$.  We do not have this information because we only have a \emph{fourth} degree Taylor Polynomial!
\end{hint}

\end{exercise}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Which of the following could be computed at $x=17$ by using the Taylor Polynomial?

\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$f(17)$}
\choice[correct]{$f'(17)$}
\choice[correct]{$f''(17)$}
\choice[correct]{$f'''(17)$}
\choice[correct]{$f^{(4)}(17)$}
\choice{$f^{(5)}(17)$}
\choice{$f^{(6)}(17)$}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{exercise}
Is there enough information to determine $f''(8)$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}


\begin{exercise}
In fact, since the coefficients of the Taylor Polynomial and the values of the derivatives of the function are related via the formula:

\[
a_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(c)}{k!}
\]
We have that $c=\answer{17}$ so we only can find an exact value of $f''(17)$ by using the Taylor Polynomial!  

(It's certainly true that we could \emph{approximate} $f''(8)$ by using this Taylor Polynomial, though without more information, it's impossible to determine how good of an approximation this would be)
