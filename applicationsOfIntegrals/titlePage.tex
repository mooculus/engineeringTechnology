\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a velocity function, calculate displacement and distance traveled.
	\item Given a velocity function, find the position function.
	\item Given an acceleration function, find the velocity function.
	\item Understand the difference between displacement and distance traveled.
	\item Understand the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration.
	\item Calculate the change in the amount.
	\item Compute the average value of the function on an interval.
	\item Understand that the average value of the function on an interval is attained by the function on that interval.

\end{itemize}
