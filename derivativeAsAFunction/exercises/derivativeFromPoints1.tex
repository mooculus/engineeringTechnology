\begin{exercise}

Let $f$ be a function such that:
\[
f(3)=-2\quad f'(3)=7\quad f(4)=3\quad f'(4)=-6
\]

Do we have enough information to evaluate
\[
\lim_{x\to3}f(x)?
\]
Select all correct statements below.

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{Yes, $\lim_{x\to3}f(x) = -2$ because $f(3)$ is given.}
\choice{No, because we are not given $f(x)$ for values of $x$ near 3.}
\choice{No, because $f$ is not necessarily continuous at 3.}
\choice{Yes, because $f$ is differentiable at 3, and therefore $f$ is continuous at 3, and therefore $\lim_{x\to3}f(x) = f'(3) = 7$.}
\choice[correct]{Yes, because $f$ is differentiable at 3, and therefore $f$ is continuous at 3, and therefore $\lim_{x\to3}f(x) = f(3) = -2$.}
\choice{No, because although $f$ is differentiable at 3, that does not mean that $f$ is continuous at 3.}

Find the following limits or write \verb|DNE| if they do not exist.

\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to3}\frac{f(x) + 2}{x - 3} &= \answer{7}\\
\lim_{x\to3}\frac{f(x) - 2}{x - 3} &= \answer{DNE}\\
\lim_{x\to3}\frac{f(x) - f(3)}{x-3} &= \answer{7}\\
\lim_{h\to1}\frac{f(3+h) + 2}{h} &= \answer{5}\\
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(3+h) + 2}{h} &= \answer{7}\\
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(4+h) - 3}{h} &= \answer{-6}\\
\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(4+h) - f(4)}{h} &= \answer{-6}
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}

The equation of the tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point where $x = 3$ is given by
\[
y = \answer{7(x-3) - 2}.
