Let $f$ be a function with $f(2) = 3$, and $f$ is a solution to the
differential equation (DE)
\[
\dd[y]{x} = x+y
\]
Use the linear approximation of $f$ near $x=2$ to approximate $f(2.5)$. 
\begin{hint}
We will approximate $f(2.5)$ with $L(2.5)$, where $L$ is the linear approximation of $f$ at $a=2$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
In order to find $L$, the linear approximation of $f$ at $a=2$, we need to find both $f(2)$ and $f'(2)$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
In order to find $L$, the linear approximation of $f$ at $a=2$, we need to find both $f(2)$ and $f'(2)$.
We already know that $f(2)=3$. Now we have to find $f'(2)$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
In order to find $L$, the linear approximation of $f$ at $a=2$, we need to find both $f(2)$ and $f'(2)$.
We already know that $f(2)=3$. Now we have to find $f'(2)$.

We know that $f$ is a solution to the DE

\dd[y]{x} = x+y

We already know that $f(2)=3$. Now we have to find $f'(2)$.

We know that $f$ is a solution to the DE
\[
\dd[y]{x} = x+y
\]
so, letting $y=f(x)$
\[
f'(x)= x+f(x),
\]
and, therefore, for $x=2$, we get
\[
f'(2)= 2+f(2)=2+3=5.
\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
Now, 
\[
L(x)=f(2)+f'(2)(x-2).
\]
Therefore,
\[
L(x)=3+5(x-2).
\]
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
Now, 
\[
f(2.5)\approx L(2.5)=3+5(2.5-2).
\]
\end{hint}
\[
f(2.5)\approx \answer{\frac{11}{2}}.
\]
