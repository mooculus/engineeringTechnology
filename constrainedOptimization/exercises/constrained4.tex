\begin{exercise}
  Find the absolute maximum and minimum of $F(x,y) = 3y-2x^2$
  constrained to the closed set bounded by the parabola $y=x^2+x-1$
  and the line $y=x$.
  
  \begin{prompt}
    The critical point within (including the boundary) this closed set
    is:
    \[
    \vec{c} = \vector{\answer{3/4},\answer{3/4}}\\
    \]
    \begin{exercise}
      The absolute maximum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
      \[
      F\left(\answer{3/4},\answer{3/4}\right) = \answer{9/8}
      \]
      The absolute minimum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
      \[
      F\left(\answer{-1},\answer{-1}\right) = \answer{-5}
      \]
