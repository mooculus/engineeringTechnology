\begin{exercise}
Consider the ideal gas law, given by $PV=nRT$, relating pressure, $P$,
volume, $V$, and the temperature $T$ of $n$ moles of gas, where $R$ is
the ideal gas constant. We can view $P$, $V$ and $T$ each as functions
of the other two variables.

If the pressure of a gas is decreasing at a rate of $0.4\unit{Pa/min}$
and the volume is increasing at a rate of $3\unit{K/min}$, how fast is
the temperature changing? Express your answer in terms of $P$, $V$,
$n$ and $R$ alone.
\begin{hint}
  Make sure your answer only contains the variables $P$, $V$, $n$, and $R$.
\end{hint}

\[
\dd[T]{t}=\answer{\frac{3P-0.4 V}{n R}}
