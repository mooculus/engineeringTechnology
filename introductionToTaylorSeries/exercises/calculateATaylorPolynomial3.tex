\begin{exercise}
For the function $f(x) = 3 \sin(x^2)$, find the sum of the first 4 nonzero terms in the Taylor series centered at $x=0$.

The sum of the first 4 nonzero terms in the Taylor series centered at $x=0$ is:

\[
3\sin(x^2) = \answer{3x^2-\frac{1}{2}x^6 +\frac{1}{40}x^{10}-\frac{1}{1680}x^{14} }+ \ldots
\]

\begin{hint}
We can construct this polynomial by using the Taylor Series centered at $x=0$ for a known function and the rules for sums, products, and compositions.

Which function below has a Taylor Series that would be helpful to start?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$\sin(x)$}
\choice{$\cos(x)$}
\choice{$e^x$}
\choice{$\frac{1}{1-x}$}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{question}

Write out several terms in the series for $\sin(x)$:

\[
\sin(x)= \answer{0} + \answer{1}x+\answer{0}x^2+\answer{\frac {-1}{3!}}x^3+\answer{0}x^4 + \answer{\frac{1}{5!}}x^5 + \answer{0}x^6+\answer{-\frac{1}{7!}}x^7 + \ldots
\]
(We may not have exhibited enough terms, but we can always exhibit more if the above is not sufficient.)

\begin{question}
Now use the rule for composition to find the series for $\sin(x^2)$ by substituting $x^2$ in for $x$ in the series above:

\[
\sin(x^2)= \answer{x^2  -\frac{1}{3!} x^6+\frac{1}{5!}x^{10}- \frac{1}{7!}x^{14}}+\ldots
\]

Now multiply through by $3$.
