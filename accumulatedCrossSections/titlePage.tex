\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Apply the procedure of ``Slice, Approximate, Integrate'' to derive a formula for volume of solids with known cross-section areas
\item Set up an integral or sum of integrals that gives the volume of a solid whose cross sections are familiar geometric shapes.
\end{itemize}

\end{sectionOutcomes}
