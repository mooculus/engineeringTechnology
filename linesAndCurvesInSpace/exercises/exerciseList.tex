%Jim's Exercises - This exercise list will not compile on my computer so I removed the exercises that caused difficulties in my exerciseListE file.  In that file, I also removed some exercises I found to be repetitive.  I cannot determine the appropriate spot for these exercises that I added, so I will leave them here for anyone to arrange in the most logical fashion.
