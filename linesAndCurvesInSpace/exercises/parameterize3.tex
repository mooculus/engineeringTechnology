\begin{exercise}
Suppose that we want to give a vector-valued function that traces out the curve described by $x=4y^2+7y-1$.  

By requiring that $y(t) = 4t$, find the position vector that traces out this curve.

\[
\vec{p}(t) = \vector{\answer{64t^2+28t-1},\answer{4t}}.
\]

\begin{exercise}
The point on the curve where $y=1$ is $(x,y) = \left(\answer{10},1\right)$. At what time $t$ is this point drawn?

\[
t = \answer{\frac{1}{4}}
\]
