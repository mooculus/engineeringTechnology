\begin{exercise}

Consider
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}
\]



\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equation of the secant line connecting the point $(1,f(1))$ to the point $(0.9,f(0.9))$?
\begin{prompt}
The equation of this secant line is
% $$ y = \answer{ -2.34568x+ 3.34568}$$
% (su18:TK) accurate answer not recognized due to lack of digits.
$$ y = \answer{ -190/81x + 271/81 }$$
\end{prompt}

\item  Use the definition of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=1$, and use this to find the equation of this tangent line.

\begin{prompt}
The equation of this tangent line is
$$ y = \answer{ -2x + 3}$$
\end{prompt}

\end{enumerate}

Isn't it cool how the coefficients in the equation of the secant line are close to those of the tangent line?
