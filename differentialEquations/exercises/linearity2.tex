\begin{exercise}
Select all of the following differential equations below that are \emph{linear}.

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$yy''+3xy=4x^2$}
\choice{$y'+x^3y=y^2$}
\choice[correct]{$y'+y\sqrt{x}=3x^2+1$}
\choice[correct]{$y''+\frac{2x}{x^2+1}y=0$}
\choice{$y''=\frac{2x}{y}$}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{hint}
Recall that an $n$-th order differential equation written in the form $f(x,y(x),y'(x), \ldots y^{(n)}(x))=0$ is \emph{linear} if $f$ is linear in $y$ and its derivatives. 

For first order equations, this means an equation is linear if it can be written in the form:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx}+p(x)y(x)=q(x)
\]


For second order equations, this means an equation is linear if it can be written in the form:

\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+p(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+q(x)y(x)=r(x)
\]

Note that the functions of $x$ that serve as the ``coefficients'' of $y$ and its derivatives can be anything!
