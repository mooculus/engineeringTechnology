\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Express the sum of n terms using sigma notation.
	\item Apply the properties of sums when working with sums in sigma notation.
	\item Understand the relationship between area under a curve and sums of areas of rectangles.
	\item Approximate area of the region under a curve.
	\item Compute left, right, and midpoint Riemann sums with 10 or fewer rectangles.
	\item Understand how Riemann sums with n rectangles are computed and how the exact value of the area is obtained by taking the limit as $n\to\infty$ .
\end{itemize}
