\begin{exercise}
  Set-up a triple integral that computes the volume of the
  intersection of these two cylinders meeting at right angles:
  \begin{image}
  \includegraphics{pipes.png}
  \end{image}
  Here the cylinders have radius $1$. One cylinder has the $x$-axis as
  its center, and the other has the $y$-axis as its center. Note, this
  intersection is known as a \textit{Steinmetz solid}.
  \begin{hint}
    The implicit inequalities for the solid cylinders are:
    \begin{align*}
      y^2+z^2 &\le 1 \\
      x^2+z^2 &\le 1
    \end{align*}
  \end{hint}
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \int_{\answer{-1}}^{\answer{1}} \int_{\answer{-\sqrt{1-z^2}}}^{\answer{\sqrt{1-z^2}}} \int_{\answer{-\sqrt{1-z^2}}}^{\answer{\sqrt{1-z^2}}} \d x \d y \d z
    \]
