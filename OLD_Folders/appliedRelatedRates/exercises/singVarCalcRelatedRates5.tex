\begin{exercise}


A rotating beacon is located 2 miles out in the water.  Let $A$ be the
point on the shore that is closest to the beacon.  As the beacon rotates at
10 rev/min, the beam of light sweeps down the shore once each time it revolves.
Assume that the shore is straight.  How fast is the point where the beam
hits the shore moving at an instant when the beam is lighting up a point 2
miles along the shore from the point $A$?
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \answer{80 \pi}\,\text{miles per minute}
  \]
