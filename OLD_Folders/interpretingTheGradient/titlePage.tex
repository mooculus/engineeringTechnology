\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the gradient vector of a function of several variables.
\item Recognize that the gradient points in the initial direction of
  greatest increase of the functions value.
\item Reconize that the gradient is normal to level sets.
\item Compute directional derivatives.
\item Find a tangent plane of an implicit surface via the gradient.
\end{itemize}
