Consider the function $f(x) = \frac{(x+2)^2}{12}$.

In the figure below the graph of $f$, the secant line between $(0,f(0))$ and $(4,f(4))$, and the linear approximation to $f$ at $a=4$ are shown.

\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xmin=-.3,xmax=6.3,ymin=-.3,ymax=6.3,
        clip=true,
        unit vector ratio*=1 1 1,
        axis lines=center,
        grid = major,
        ytick={-6,-5,...,6},
    xtick={-6,-5,...,6},
        xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
        every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
        every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
      ]
      \addplot[very thick,penColor,domain=-0.3:6.3] plot{(x+2)^2/12};
      \addplot[thick,red,domain=-0.3:6.3] plot{(x-4)+3};
      \addplot[thick,black,domain=-0.3:6.3] plot{2/3*(x-4)+3};
            
      \node at (axis cs: 4.5,5.5) {$y=f(x)$};
      \end{axis}`
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

The slope of the secant line depicted is
\[
m_{sec} = \answer{\frac{2}{3}}.
\]

The linear approximation $L$ to $f$ at $a=4$ is
\[
L(x) = \answer{(x-4) + 3}.
\]

Using this linear approximation, we can estimate $f$ at $x=4.01$ as
\[
f(4.01) \approx \answer{3.01}.
\]
This estimate is an \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{underestimate}\choice{overestimate}} because the second derivative of $f$ is \wordChoice{\choice{negative}\choice[correct]{positive}} and the graph of $L$ lies \wordChoice{\choice{above}\choice[correct]{below}} the graph of $f$.

When $x$ changes from $a=4$ to $a+\Delta x=4.01$, $f(x)$ changes by $\Delta y$ (rounded to the thousands place) given by
\[
\Delta y = f\left(\answer{4.01}\right) - f\left(\answer{4}\right) = \answer{0.01}.
\]
We can also estimate this change in $f(x)$ as $\d{y}$ given by
\[
\d{y} = f'\left(\answer{4}\right)\d{x} = \answer{0.01}.
\]
We see that our approximation of the change in $f(x)$ is very close to the true change.
