In Einstein's theory of relativity, we can derive that

$$E(v) = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

where $E(v)$ is the energy of an object with ``Rest mass'' $m$ and velocity $v$.

Let us analyze this more closely.

First find the linear approximation to the function $f(u) = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-u}}$ at $u=0$.

Using this approximation, and substituting $u = \frac{v^2}{c^2}$, we can obtain an approximation for $E(v)$ which is valid for small velocities $v$.

The approximation you obtain should have two terms.  One of which is the famous $E = mc^2$ (representing the resting energy) and the other should be the classical kinetic energy of the object.

\begin{prompt}
	The local linearization of $\frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1-u}}$ at $u=0$ is $\answer{m c^2 +\frac{m c^2}{2}u}$.

	So we get that $E(v) \approx \answer{mc^2+\frac{1}{2}mv^2}$.
\end{prompt}
