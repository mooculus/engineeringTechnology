\begin{exercise}

An object is moving along a horizontal line.  Let $s(t)$ be the position function of the object, where  $s$ is measured in meters and $t$ is measured in seconds.  The graph of $s$ is given below.


\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xmin=-0.3,xmax=4.3,ymin=-1.7,ymax=1.7,
        clip=true,
        unit vector ratio*=1 1 1,
        axis lines=center,
        grid = major,
        ytick={-1,0,...,1},
    xtick={0,1,...,4},
        xlabel=$t$, ylabel=$y$,
        every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
        every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
      ]
      \addplot[very thick,penColor,domain=0:2,samples=50] plot{-(x-1)^3};
      \addplot[very thick,penColor,domain=2:4,samples=50] plot{-(x-4)^2/4};
      
      \node at (axis cs:2.5,0.5) [black] {$y = s(t)$};
      \end{axis}`
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Use the graph to answer the following questions.

\[
s(0) = \answer{1}
\]

The object is at the origin at $t = \answer{1}$ and $t = \answer{4}$.

The object is furthest from the origin at times $t = \answer{0}$ and $t = \answer{2}$.

The average velocity of the object during the time interval $[0,2]$ is
\[
v_{\text{av}} = \answer{-1}\text{m/s.}
\]

For the following problems, remember that instantaneous velocity of the object at a given $t$ is equal to the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $s$ at the point $(t,s(t))$.  Let $v(t)$ be the instantaneous velocity of the object at time $t$.

For each of the following pairs select the larger of the two.

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$v(2.5)$}
\choice{$v(3.5)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$v(0.2)$}
\choice[correct]{$v(0.8)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$v(1.3)$}
\choice{$v(1.8)$}
\end{multipleChoice}

Select each interval on which the object has a positive instantaneous velocity.

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$(0,1)$}
\choice{$(1,2)$}
\choice[correct]{$(2,4)$}
\end{selectAll}
