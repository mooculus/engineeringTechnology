Which of the following differential equations are separable?

\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{xy^2}$}
\choice[correct]{$\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{x+y^2}$}
\choice{$\frac{dy}{dx} + \sin(xy) = 0$}
\choice{$\cos(x)\frac{dy}{dx} = 5\ln(xy)$}
\choice[correct]{$\frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dx}  = y^2$}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{hint}
Recall that an equation is \emph{separable} if it can be brought into the form:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y) 
\]

\begin{question}
For the equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{xy^2}$, can this be done?  Can we factor out a function of $x$ or $y$ from the righthand side so it becomes a product of a function of $x$ and $y$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes}
\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}

\begin{question}
For the equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{x+y^2}$, can this be done? Can we factor out a function of $x$ or $y$ from the righthand side so it becomes a product of a function of $x$ and $y$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes}
\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

In fact, using laws of exponents, we can write:

\[
e^{x+y^2} = e^{x} \cdot e^{\answer{y^2}}
\]
So, we may write $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{xe^y}{y} = g(x)h(y)$ if $g(x) = \answer{e^x}$ and $h(y) = \answer{e^{y^2}}$
\end{question}

\begin{question}
For $\frac{dy}{dx} + \sin(xy) = 0$, we can write:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{-\sin(xy)}
\]

Can we factor out a function of $x$ or $y$ from the righthand side so it becomes a product of a function of $x$ and $y$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}

\begin{question}
For $\cos(x)\frac{dy}{dx} = 5\ln(xy)$, we can write:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{\frac{5\ln(xy)}{\cos(x)}}
\]

Can we factor out a function of $x$ or $y$ from the righthand side so it becomes a product of a function of $x$ and $y$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

Note that the rules for logarithms tell us that $\ln(xy) = \ln(x) + \ln(y)$!

\begin{question}
For $\frac{1}{x} \frac{dy}{dx}  = y^2$, we can write:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{xy^2}
\]

Can we factor out a function of $x$ or $y$ from the righthand side so it becomes a product of a function of $x$ and $y$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Yes}
\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

In fact, $\frac{dy}{dx} = xy^2 = g(x)h(y)$ if $g(x) =\answer{x}$ and $h(y) = \answer{y^2}$.
