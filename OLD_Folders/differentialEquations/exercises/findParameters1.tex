\begin{exercise}
Consider the differential equation $y'(x) + y(x) =2x+4$.  Find real values for $a$ and $b$ such that $y(x) = 3e^{-x}+ax+b$ is a solution to the equation, or state that there are no such values.

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{There are no such values for $a$ and $b$ for which $y(x) = 3e^{-x}+ax+b$ is a solution.}
\choice[correct]{There are values for $a$ and $b$ for which  $y(x) = 3e^{-x}+ax+b$ is a solution.}
\end{multipleChoice}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{hint}
To check, find the indicated derivatives:

\begin{align*}
y(x) & = 3e^{-x}+ax+b \\
y'(x) &= \answer{-3e^{-x}+a} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{question}
Substituting these into the differential equation gives: 

\[ y'(x) + y(x)= (-3e^{-x}+a) + (3e^{-x}+ax+b )= 2x+4\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[  \left( \answer{a} \right)x +\left(\answer{a+b}\right) = 2x+4 \]

In order for this relationship to hold for all $x$-values, the coefficients of the like powers of $x$ must be equal.  

By comparing the coefficients of the $x$ term on both sides, we find $a=\answer{2}$.

By comparing the coefficients of the $x$ term on both sides, we find $a+b=4$, so $b=\answer{2}$.

\end{question}
\end{hint}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We find that $a=\answer{2}$ and $b=\answer{2}$.
