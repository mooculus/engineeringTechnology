\outcome{Calculate the gradient.}

\begin{document}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose that $F(x,y) = 4x^2+3xy+5$.  Then,

\begin{align*}
\grad{F}(x,y) &= \vector{\answer{8x+3y},\answer{3x}} \\
\grad{F}(1,2) &= \vector{\answer{14},\answer{3}}
\end{align*}

\begin{hint}
The gradient is a vector-valued function whose first component is the
partial derivative of the function with respect to $x$ and whose
second component is the partial derivative of the function with
respect to $y$; that is

\[
\grad{F} = \vector{F_x(x,y) , F_y(x,y)}.
\]

To compute it, we just calculate the partial derivatives and insert them in the appropriate component.
