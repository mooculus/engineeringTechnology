\begin{exercise}
Consider the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-4x^2}$.  We find the radius of convergence two ways:

\begin{exercise}
We can use the rules of composition to find the radius of convergence for the Taylor series centered at $x=0$ for $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-4x^2}$.  

Since:

\[
 \frac{1}{1-4x^2} =  \frac{1}{1-(4x^2)},
\]
we would find the Taylor series for $f(x)$ by substituting $4x^2$ for $x$ in the Taylor  series centered at $x=0$ for $ \frac{1}{1-x}$.  This also applies for the radius of convergence:

The series for $\frac{1}{1-x}$ converges when $|x|<\answer{1}$, so the series for $ \frac{1}{1-4x^2}$ will converge when $\left|\answer{4x^2}\right|<1$.  

\begin{exercise}
Simplifying:

\[|4x^2| = \answer{4} \cdot |x|^{\answer{2}} <1\]

and thus: $|x| < \answer{\frac{1}{2}}$.  The radius of convergence is thus $\answer{\frac{1}{2}}$.

\end{exercise}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Another way to proceed is to use the Ratio Test to check the Taylor series for absolute convergence.  Using the usual rules for compositions, the Taylor series centered at $x=0$ for $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-4x^2}$ is:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1-x} &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x^k \\
\frac{1}{1-(4x^2)} &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\answer{4x^2}\right)^k \\
&= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}4^{\answer{k}} \cdot x^{\answer{2k}}
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
Thus, the limit that must be evaluated by using the Ratio Test is:

\[
L(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{4^{n+1}x^{2(n+1)}}{4^nx^{2n}}\right|
\]

Computing this limit gives: $L(x) = \left|\answer{4x^2}\right|$.

Since the series converges for all $x$-values that make $L(x)<1$ and diverges for all $x$-values that make $L(x)>1$, the radius of convergence for the series is found by setting:

\[
\left|4x^2\right|<1
\]
and the radius of convergence is thus $\frac{1}{2}$.
