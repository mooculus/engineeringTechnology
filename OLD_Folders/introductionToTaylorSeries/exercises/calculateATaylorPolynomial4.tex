\begin{exercise}
For the function $f(x) = \sin(2x) + \cos(3x)$, find the seventh degree Taylor polynomial centered at $x=0$.

The seventh degree Taylor polynomial is:

\[ 
p_7(x) = \answer{
1+ 2x - \frac{9}{2} x^2 - \frac{4}{3} x^3 + \frac{27}{8} x^4 + \frac{4}{15} x^5  - \frac{81}{80} x^6 - \frac{8}{315} x^7}
 \]

\begin{hint}
We can construct this polynomial by using the Taylor Series centered at $x=0$ for a known function and the rules for sums, products, and compositions.

Which functions below have a Taylor Series that would be helpful to start?
\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$\sin(x)$}
\choice[correct]{$\cos(x)$}
\choice{$e^x$}
\choice{$\frac{1}{1-x}$}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{question}
Write out several terms in the series for $\sin(2x)$:

\[
\sin(2x) = \answer{0} + \answer{2}x+\answer{0}x^2+\answer{\frac{-4}{3}}x^3+\answer{0}x^4 +  \answer{\frac{4}{15}}x^5+\answer{0}x^6+\answer{\frac{-8}{ 315}}x^7+ \ldots
\]
(We may not have exhibited enough terms, but we can always exhibit more if the above is not sufficient.)

\begin{question}
Write out several terms in the series for $\cos(3x)$:

\[
\cos(3x) = \answer{1} + \answer{0}x+\answer{- \frac{9}{2}}x^2+\answer{0}x^3+\answer{ \frac{27}{8} }x^4 +  \answer{0}x^5+\answer{\frac{-81}{80}}x^6+\answer{0}x^7+ \ldots
\]
(We may not have exhibited enough terms, but we can always exhibit more if the above is not sufficient.)

From this, you can combine like terms and extract the seventh degree Taylor polynomial.
