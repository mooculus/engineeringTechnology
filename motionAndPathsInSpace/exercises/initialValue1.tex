\begin{exercise}
  The starting position of a particle is given by
  \[
  \vec{p}(0) =\vector{0,0,0}
  \]
  and its acceleration is described by the vector-valued function
  $\vec{a} (t) = \vector{-3,0,-6t}$ for $t \geq 0$. Suppose the
  initial velocity is given by $\vec{v}(0) =\vector{60,10,75}$.
  Find:
\begin{itemize}
\item The velocity function: $\vec{v}(t) =\vector{\answer{-3t+60},\answer{10},\answer{-3t^2+75}}$
\item The speed function: $\vec{s}(t) = \answer{\sqrt{9t^4-441t^2-360t+9325}}$ 
\item The position function: $\vec{p}(t) = \vector{\answer{-3t^2/2+60t},\answer{10t},\answer{-t^3+75t}}$
\item The maximum $z$-height of the particle when $t \geq 0$:
  \[
  \text{maximum height:}\quad \answer{250}
  \]
\end{itemize}
